# SSL Cert Creation and DNS validation
- Created a public certificate in AWS Certificate Manger with domain name *.akshayreddy.online
- For validation, copied the CNAME name _c79b5ef2cd29a70241c4cfc6fdf8f153 and complete CNAME value _8202f8926eef1a71780cdb519b8c3a60.sdgjtdhdhz.acm-validations.aws. and removed the dot at last and created a CNAME DNS record in my Godaddy DNS management.
- Certificate is issued.
